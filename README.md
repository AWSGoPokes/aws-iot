# aws-iot
AWS IoT Competition

## SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Makers must do the following to participate in the Hackathon: 

* Register for the Hackathon on the Hackathon Website by clicking the “Register for this Hackathon” button. To complete registration, sign up to create a Devpost account, or log in with an existing Devpost account. There is no charge for creating a Devpost account. This will enable you to receive important updates and access the “Enter a Submission” page.
* Sign up for a developer account on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). You can get started with AWS for free. The AWS Free Tier includes select services available for 12 months following your AWS sign-up date, as well as additional service offers that do not automatically expire at the end of your 12 month AWS Free Tier term. 
* Once you have an AWS account, sign up for AWS IoT Platform and/or Amazon Kinesis.
* AWS IoT Platform includes a free tier of 250,000 messages (published or delivered) per month for 12 months. When your 12-month free usage term expires, or if your application use exceeds the free tier, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates. Details and terms here: https://aws.amazon.com/iot-platform/pricing/.
* Amazon Kinesis does not include a free tier but Amazon will provide a $25 in AWS Credit to individuals registered for the Hackathon and the credits will be valid for the duration of the Hackathon. In order to receive AWS Credits, you must complete the form at https://pages.awscloud.com/devadopt_NAMER_AWS-IoT-App-Challenge.html and provide your AWS Account ID.  
* Create a working software application using Amazon Kinesis, AWS IoT, or both.
* Create a demonstration video that shows your application in action.
* Enter your application during the Hackathon Submission Period:
* Include a link to your application code on GitHub or BitBucket. Your code repository may be public or private. If your repository is private, access must be given in the testing instructions provided with your submission. Code will be used only for application review and testing.
* Include deployment files and testing instructions needed for testing your application. Include your AWS CloudFormation template file and if needed for your solution, include any side scripts of HTML pages needed for deployment.
* Include any sample data you used for development in CSV or JSON format. If you generated the data using the Kinesis Data Generator or the AWS IoT Simulator, include instructions so we can regenerate the sample data for testing purposes.
* Complete and enter all of the required fields and questions on the “Enter a Submission” page of the Hackathon Website, including explaining how the application is cost-effective, scalable, and well-implemented and how it can impact individuals, businesses, or communities. Follow the additional requirements outlined below.
